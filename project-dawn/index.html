            ISLAMABAD: After weeks of deliberations, Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) Senator Anwaarul Haq Kakar was named
            the caretaker prime minister after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Opposition Leader Raja Riaz reached a
            consensus over his “surprise” nomination.

            Mr Kakar, who hails from Balochistan, will become the eighth caretaker prime minister. President Dr Arif
            Alvi signed a summary sent to him by the outgoing prime minister regarding his appointment after the second
            round of talks with Raja Riaz.

            The initial positive reactions over his surprise nomination demonstrated how Mr Kakar was acceptable to all
            political parties, especially those part of the ruling coalition headed by outgoing PM Shehbaz Sharif. In
            addition, the BAP is thought to have the backing of the country’s establishment.

            A member of the outgoing ruling coalition told Dawn on the condition of anonymity that Mr Kakar was a
            “surprise” for many in the alliance; in fact, “even those who signed the summary of Kakar’s nomination were
            unaware of Kakar’s name.”

            “Mr Kakar’s name came from somewhere else and it had to be accepted by all

            stakeholders,” the politician said while responding to a question about the Sharifs’ failure to get their
            own man in the caretaker’s saddle.

          <p>A similar comment was made by PPP leader Syed Khursheed Shah, who said no one was aware that Mr Kakar would
            become the interim PM. He said the PPP had proposed three names and they were better options. He said, “We
            should hope for the best irrespective of the fact where the name (of Kakar) came from.”

            However, Raja Riaz told reporters, “I had given this name and the PM has</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            consented to this name ... the PM and I have signed the summary.” He claimed Mr Kakar would be sworn in
            tomorrow (Sunday).

            However, a source in the Presidency told Dawn that the caretaker prime minister would take oath in a day or
            two.

            Mr Riaz said it had been decided between him and Mr Sharif that they would not disclose other names that
            remained under consideration. Both sides had already expressed their “desire that the caretaker prime
            minister should be from a smaller province.”

            Soon after the signing of the summary by the president, Mr Kakar was provided with the security and protocol
            reserved for the prime ministers.

            In the farewell reception hosted by the prime minister on Friday night, the coalition partners had given
            full authority to Mr Sharif to decide any name for the coveted slot. According to an official statement
            issued by the PMO, PM Sharif after signing the summary expressed gratitude to Raja Riaz for his cooperation
            in the consultative process and for being the leader of the opposition during the 16 months of the coalition
            government.

            BAP Senator Abdul Qadir said his party had been making efforts for —

          The past few days to get Mr Kakar nominated for the office of caretaker premier.

          He said Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani was lobbying for Mr Kakar and had met PM Shehbaz, opposition leader
          Raja Riaz, Pakistan Democratic Movement chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and other senior leaders of PML-N over the
          past few days.

          The delay in nominating a caretaker prime minister was apparently because Mr Riaz, generally believed to be a
          “friendly opposition leader,” came out to be a different man, as he had been insisting on his candidate
          instead of agreeing to the names suggested by the PML-N.
